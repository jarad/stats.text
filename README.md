# stats.text


A free and open-source statistics textbook. Originally this book is being developed for STAT 401A at Iowa State University, but the expectation is that it will be created in such a way that individual instructors can pull relevant components to build material suitable to their course. 


## Design requirements

The formats this textbook should be able to printed to are
- viewed as HTML textbook
- viewed as HTML slides for a lecture
- printed to a pdf
- sent to an on-demand printer for binding

For printing to a pdf and on-demand printing, an option should be available so that only desired components are printed.


## Components

This textbook will have the following components
- Mathematics
- Description
- Theory
- Homework
  - Solutions
- Activities


### Mathematics

This component of the textbook will succinctly describe the mathematics involved for that particular section of the textbook. No attempt will be made here to describe the intuition or derivation behind the formulas as that will be left to the Description section. 

### Description

This component of the textbook will describe the intution behind the formulas described in the Mathematics section.

### Theory

This component of the textbook will describe the theory behind the derivation of the mathematical formulas descibed in the Mathematics section.

### Homework

This section will provide homework problems that will also serve as case studies for the methods previously described.

#### Solutions

Along with homework problems solutions will be provided that will serve as walk-throughs of the case studies.

### Activities

This section provides 50-minute team activities based on a Team-Based Learning approach to eduction.
